> Lightweight and customizable audio visualization toolkit build up on web audio api.

> It currently uses canvas2D as the graphic engine, I will implement the ability to use Three.js later.
> 

> Demo: https://eggtronic.github.io/web-audio-visualization-tool/

## ‚ú® Features
- üåà Customizable - provides lifecycle hooks for audio visualization and interaction.
- üõ° Modularity - use imagination to create your own audio visualization or audio player.
- üì¶ Lightweight - only few lines of code.
- üé® Ready to go - there are some ready to use hooks implemented for you.
  
## ‚ú® Experimental Features
- üåà BPM detection - use web-audio-beat-detector to detect BPM of the audio
      Unstable, since it requires an AudioBuffer as input which is not provided by the audio element. Currently, I remain the original audio element since it is easy to handle the audio control. I uses another AJAX http request to get the buffer from the same audio source to get the BPM.
      I wish one day, the we can get the AudioBuffer from audio element, before that, I would like to move BPM as a util function.
     
     You can see a log of BPM info from browser console (f12) once audio has been loaded.
     You can access the BPM detection function through util (I will move it to util soon).

## üñ• Environment Support
- Currently only support the latest browsers such as Chrome, but will implement the support for more browers in the future.

## üî® Basic Usage (Development)
> 1. Run `npm install`
> 2. Run `npx rollup -c` to pack (I will put this on to cdn later)
> 2. In your html body you need create 2 canvas element and 1 audio element. Don't forget to add the script.
```html
    <audio id="myAudio" src="..." data-author="..." data-title="..."></audio>
    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="800" height="400"></canvas>
    <canvas id="myStaticCanvas" width="800" height="400"></canvas>

    <script src='./lib/index.js'></script>
    <script type="module" src='example.js'></script>
```

> 3. Create an example.js file and copy the js code below into it. (you can also use your own name)
> 4. You will need to reference 2 canvas element id and  1 audio element id to init the AudioVisualizer.
> 5. (optional) You can reference your own canvases.
> 6. You can reuse my example style for a better preview (it's in the index.html)
